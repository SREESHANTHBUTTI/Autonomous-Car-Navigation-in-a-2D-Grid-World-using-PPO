# Autonomous-Car-Navigation-in-a-2D-Grid-World-using-PPO
This project implements a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent trained inside a fully custom GridWorld environment built using Gymnasium. The agent learns to navigate from a start position to a goal position while avoiding obstacles, optimizing its movements through trial-and-error interaction.
